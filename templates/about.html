        <h3>Rice Crop Disease Prediction</h3>
        <p>Rice being one of the imperative food crops of the word contributes immensely to the food and nutritional security of India. The cultivation of rice is changed over the decades from a simple cultivation practices to the advanced cultivation to increase yield. With the change in rice cultivation practices, problems also aroused side by side.</p>
        <p>A number of biotic and abiotic stresses emerged as major constraints for rice cultivation in diverse agro-climatic conditions and growing ecologies. Diseases are the major biotic constraints to rice which can reduce the yields by 20–100% based on severity. Major diseases like blast, brown spot, bacterial blight, sheath blight and tungro still causing more damage. The losses due to these diseases may 1–100% based on the growing conditions, varietal susceptibility etc.</p>
        <p>This application uses Support Vector Machine to predict diseases by analyzing rice leaf images. Proper diagnosis of the disease will help in deciding the control measures and prevent more damage. Apart from disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment methods are also suggested.</p>
